# Ripple Labs Inc
## Ribble Labs Inc is a global blockchain company that offers an open source payment system and a math-based virtual currency powering distributed currency exchange, merchant paymetns, money transfers, and remittances. 
Ripple Labs Inc was founded in 2012 with the name OpenCoin Inc and later incorporated with a new name, Ripple Labs Inc in September 2013. It was founded by Chris Larsen, Jeb McCaleb, and Arthur Britto although Britto's involvement is a point of contention. Ripple Labs has its origins from back in 2004 when a man named Ryan Fugger took on the initiation to create decentralized network that allowed individuals to extend credit and exchange debt within their network. Fugger later agreed to hand over his project to Chris Larsen and Jeb McCaleb when the latter two approached him with their own digital currency project. 

## Business Activities

Ripple seeks to improve the inefficient and expensive cross-border payments as well as the global banking system through its distributed ledger. Apart from individuals using its XRP token to make cross-border payments, well established financial institutions use Ripple products through a network called RippleNet. According to Ripple Inc's website, some of its notable clients include Bank of America, Banco Rendimento of Brazil, IndusInd Bank of India, the Saudi British Bank SABB, and several other banks and exchanges. 

Ripple Inc's producrs appear to edge over competitors in some aspects. For example, XRP which is considered a natural competitor to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin offers a significantly faster transaction processing time due to its reliance on consensus rather than proof-of-work that is in the case of Bitcoin and the other major cryptocurrencies. XRP also consumes much less electricity than the electricity that is required by bitcoin and ethereum mining. 

## Landscape
Ripple Inc can be classified as being in the Payments/Billing domain. This domain has seen a remarkable transformation over the past decade as mobile payment services and cryptocurrcies became widely popular especially in the developed world. 

Last year, the global mobile payment market was worth close to $2 trillion while 10 years ago, only a fraction of that amount was processed via mobile payments. The cryptocurrencies also boosting cross-border payments have grown to have a market cap of more than a trillion dollars compared to a decade ago of having a market cap less than $10bn. 

## Results
Ripple Inc boasts of its accomplishments in its website and the impact its products have had around the world. Its crypto and blockchain products facilitated $150mm worth of donations made to humanitarian causes by its NGO partners since 2018. Its NGO partners operate in more than 80 countries and its services have enabled low-cost, reliable remittances in developing countries as well as helping build Cenreal Bank Digital Currency Platforms. 

Ripple is currently not as widely popular as its main competitors such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and the other remmitance service providers that have been around for decades. 

## Recommendations
As an immigrant who regularily send remittance to family in the developing world via Western Union, I think Western Union could highly benefit from adopting XRP given the slow and often complicated process to send money to countries with poor infrastructure and low banking access. By adopting XRP, Western Union can have an advantage over its competitors such as Money Gram who rely in the same slow and expensive infrastructure to facilitate remittance.
