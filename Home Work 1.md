## Ribble Labs Inc is a global blockchain company that offers an open source payment system and a math-based virtual currency powering distributed currency exchange, merchant paymetns, money transfers, and remittances. 
Ripple Labs Inc was founded in 2012 with the name OpenCoin Inc and later incorporated with a new name, Ripple Labs Inc in September 2013. It was founded by Chris Larsen, Jeb McCaleb, and Arthur Britto although Britto's involvement is a point of contention. Ripple Labs has its origins from back in 2004 when a man named Ryan Fugger took on the initiation to create decentralized network that allowed individuals to extend credit and exchange debt within their network. Fugger later agreed to hand over his project to Chris Larsen and Jeb McCaleb when the latter two approached him with their own digital currency project.
